# Tag Otter

A Chrome extension that checks UTM parameters on ad platform URLs and flags problems before they cost you data.

Works on Meta Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Pinterest Ads, and Snapchat Ads.

## What it does

Tag Otter scans URL fields on ad platforms and catches tracking mistakes: missing UTM parameters, misspelled tokens, wrong platform tokens, broken characters, and more. When it finds something, it shows you what's wrong and what the fix looks like.

There's also a URL builder for creating tracked links from scratch, with templates for each platform.

Everything runs locally in your browser. No accounts, no servers, no data leaves your device.

## Install
